Assignment number: 1

Got help from 20200208 Seunghyun Do, he has checked few of my errors.

spent time: About 30 hours

I have learned the importance of the DFA before coding because I made new codes after drawing DFA after 20 hours spent.
Also, I have learned character seemed very flexible because if I put int number, it transfers to alphabet using ASCII codes.
