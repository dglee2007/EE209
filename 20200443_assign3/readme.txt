Using Array
- Pros: Used memory smaller than Hash Table. When we approach all 
items in database, it takes shorter time than Hash Table. 
- Cons: For register, unregister, it is necessary to look for most database 
which spends very long time. 
Using Hash Table
- Pros: Using Hash function, the number of data to count on
  in the register, unregister are relatively small which makes faster than Array.
- Cons: Extra calculation for hash function cause occupying more spaces and slower speed.
